Gríma variable is a versatile OpenType variable font for the Scandinavian younger futhark runes, developed for my MSc dissertation under orientation of professors Artur Rebelo and Sérgio Rebelo.

It is best used as a webfont or with Adobe applications, or in other applications that support OpenType Variable Fonts.
